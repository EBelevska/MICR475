## In-class Assignment 09/25/23

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library("readr")
library(tidyr)

read_csv("fake_eagle_nest_counts.csv") -> eagle_nests
```
I would say that this is not tidy because of the different regions. In order to get the data to be tidy, I would combine the different regions into one and then plot the year on the x-axis and the number of eagle's nests on the y-axis. 
```{r}
eagle_data <- eagle_nests|>
  pivot_longer(cols = !starts_with("year"),
              names_to = "regions",
              values_to = "nests")
```
Creating a scatter plot with the data:
```{r}
x <- eagle_data$year
y <- eagle_data$nests
plot(x, y, main = "Eagle Nests", 
     xlab = "years", ylab = "regions",)
```
