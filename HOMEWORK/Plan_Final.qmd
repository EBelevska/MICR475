## Final Project Plan

1. This is a solo project. 

2. My project is an analysis.

3. I am planning on analyzing a time series data set by using the prophet package. The problem my analysis will solve is looking at trends in the data. My analysis will use prophet to show any trends in the data that may have occurred as time has passed. Furthermore, my analysis will also show if there are any peaks in the data. This could help us draw conclusions from the data set.
