```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(nycflights13)

flights2 <- flights |> 
  select(year, time_hour, origin, dest, tailnum, carrier)
flights2 |> 
  left_join(airlines) |> 
  nrow()
nrow(flights2)
```


# Joins

1. Imagine youâ€™ve found the top 10 most popular destinations using this code:
```{r}
top_dest <- flights2 |>
  count(dest, sort = TRUE) |>
  head(10)
```
How can you find all flights to those destinations?
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
all_flights <- top_dest |>
  left_join(flights)
sum(is.na(flights2$name))
select(flights, dest)
```

# Functions

2. Write a function to 'rescale' a numeric vector by subtracting the mean of the vector from each element and then dividing each element by the standard deviation. 
```{r}
v <- (1:5)

rescale <- function(v) {
  ( v - mean(v, na.rm = TRUE)) / sd(v, na.rm = TRUE)
}

rescale(v)
```
